# Implementation Plan: Authenticated Proxy Art Generation

**Branch**: `002-json-arguments-argument` | **Date**: 2025-09-19 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/mnt/e/L/proxy_art/specs/002-json-arguments-argument/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Create a steganographic art generation platform that disguises proxy configuration access through an artistic interface. Users provide JSON parameters that appear to control art generation but secretly contain authentication credentials. When authenticated, the system fetches favicons from subscription URLs and integrates them into the generated art while providing one-click access to proxy configuration files. The system must silently degrade to standard art generation if authentication fails, maintaining perfect disguise.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: JavaScript/TypeScript (Vue.js frontend), JavaScript (Vercel Functions backend)  
**Primary Dependencies**: Vue.js 3, Vercel Functions, existing proxy configuration system  
**Storage**: N/A (stateless configuration retrieval)  
**Testing**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Vue Test Utils, Jest or other framework]  
**Target Platform**: Web (Vercel deployment)
**Project Type**: web - determines source structure (frontend + backend)  
**Performance Goals**: Maintain response time parity between authenticated/non-authenticated requests for steganographic purposes  
**Constraints**: Silent failure modes, aesthetic integrity of generated art, complete functional disguise  
**Scale/Scope**: Personal project with steganographic requirements, leveraging existing authentication system

**Implementation Context from User**:
- Leverage existing codes with authentication for proxy configuration access via password and URLs
- Reuse Vue.js and Vercel Functions tech stack
- Add backend favicon fetching capability with base64 encoding integration
- Refactor frontend from 2 input sections + 3 result sections to 1 input section + 1 canvas result section
- Canvas section displays generative art and conditionally shows favicon texture with click-to-copy functionality

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Steganographic Artistry (Principle I)
✅ **PASS**: Feature maintains legitimate generative art facade with aesthetically compelling outputs
✅ **PASS**: Dual nature (art frontend + VPN backend) remains seamlessly integrated and non-obvious

### Creative Experimentation (Principle II)  
✅ **PASS**: Innovation in favicon integration and single-canvas design prioritizes visual impact
✅ **PASS**: Experimental approach to parameter disguise enhances artistic facade

### Dual-Purpose Architecture (Principle III)
✅ **PASS**: All UI elements serve both art generation and authentication purposes
✅ **PASS**: JSON parameters have plausible artistic interpretation while hiding auth credentials
✅ **PASS**: Visual outputs encode configuration data within artistic patterns

### Cryptographic Discretion (Principle IV)
✅ **PASS**: VPN functionality completely hidden behind creative parameter interface
✅ **PASS**: Password and subscription URLs appear as artistic parameters
✅ **PASS**: Configuration data encrypted and presented as art metadata/visual elements

### Complete Steganographic Concealment (Principle V)
✅ **PASS**: No easter eggs or discoverable hints in public interface
✅ **PASS**: Website appears as purely legitimate generative art platform
✅ **PASS**: Hidden features only accessible through predetermined authentication methods

**Result**: All constitutional principles satisfied. No violations to document in Complexity Tracking.

**Structure Decision**: Option 2 (Web application) - Frontend + Backend structure based on Vue.js + Vercel Functions architecture

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude` for your AI assistant
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P] 
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation 
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |

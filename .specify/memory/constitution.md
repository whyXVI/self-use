# Proxy Art Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Steganographic Artistry
The primary interface MUST present as a legitimate generative art experiment. Visual outputs SHALL be aesthetically compelling and algorithmically interesting. The dual nature (art frontend + VPN backend) MUST remain seamlessly integrated and non-obvious to casual observers.

**Rationale**: The disguise is the core feature - making VPN functionality invisible while creating genuinely engaging art experiences.

### II. Creative Experimentation
Innovation and visual impact take precedence over strict engineering practices. Code MAY prioritize creative expression, artistic algorithms, and novel visual techniques. Experimental approaches SHOULD be embraced when they enhance the artistic disguise.

**Rationale**: This is a personal creative project where artistic merit and steganographic cleverness matter more than enterprise-grade architecture.

### III. Dual-Purpose Architecture
Every user-facing feature MUST serve both the art generation facade and the hidden VPN configuration functionality. UI elements SHALL have plausible artistic purposes while secretly accepting authentication parameters. Visual outputs MAY encode configuration data within artistic patterns.

**Rationale**: Maintaining believable cover requires that all elements authentically serve the artistic narrative.

### IV. Cryptographic Discretion
VPN functionality MUST remain completely hidden behind creative interfaces. Password validation and subscription URL processing SHALL appear as artistic parameter inputs. Configuration data MUST be encrypted and presented as generated art metadata or visual elements.

**Rationale**: Security through obscurity is intentional - the goal is to hide functionality, not advertise it.

### V. Intuitive Discovery
Hidden features SHOULD be discoverable through creative exploration rather than documentation. Easter eggs, visual cues, and artistic metaphors MAY guide knowledgeable users to VPN functionality. The learning curve SHOULD feel like artistic discovery, not technical configuration.

**Rationale**: The user experience should feel magical and artistic, with technical functionality emerging naturally from creative interaction.

## Creative Standards

Art generation MUST produce visually interesting outputs even without VPN parameters. Algorithms SHOULD create unique, non-repetitive patterns that could plausibly be generative art. Visual outputs SHALL maintain artistic integrity while potentially encoding functional data.

Color palettes, geometric patterns, and artistic styles MAY be influenced by VPN subscription metadata. Generated art MUST be downloadable and shareable as legitimate creative works.

## Development Approach

Code organization MAY prioritize creative clarity over enterprise patterns. Experimental visual algorithms SHOULD be encouraged and iteratively refined. Comments and documentation MAY use artistic metaphors and creative language.

Feature additions MUST enhance either the artistic facade or the steganographic functionality. Breaking changes are acceptable when they improve the creative deception or artistic output quality.

## Governance

This constitution celebrates creative experimentation over rigid engineering practices. The primary success metric is the seamless integration of art generation with hidden VPN functionality.

All development decisions MUST consider both artistic impact and steganographic effectiveness. Code reviews SHALL evaluate creative merit alongside functional correctness. Complexity is justified when it enhances the artistic disguise or creates more compelling visual outputs.
